# n8n Workflows for mcp-cloud.ai

This repository shares various n8n workflows to provide examples on how users can use mcp-cloud.ai to host their MCPs.

## Workflows

The `workflows` directory contains the following examples:

*   **Airbnb Investment Advisor**: An intelligent agent that analyzes vacation rental investment opportunities across multiple cities. It uses a memory system to build a knowledge graph of market data over time.
*   **Daily Market Intelligence**: A workflow that automatically generates a comprehensive market intelligence report, leveraging multiple data sources for sentiment, fundamental, and technical analysis.
